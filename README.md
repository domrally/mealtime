state machines made in typescript

## Design Patterns
the State, Proxy, and Observer patterns 
are three of twenty-three design patterns documented 
by the Gang of Four

### the State Pattern 
> see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern
> allows an object to alter its behavior 
> when its internal state changes.
> This pattern is close to
> the concept of finite-state machines

### the Proxy Pattern
> see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern
> In short, a proxy is a wrapper or agent object 
> that is being called by the client 
> to access the real serving object behind the scenes.
> Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object
> or can provide additional logic

### Observer Pattern
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern
> an object, named the subject,
> maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, 
> and notifies them automatically of any state changes, 
> usually by calling one of their methods
